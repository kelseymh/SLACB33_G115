From Noah Kurinsky:

I think we should aim to simulate G115, a 3”x4mm Ge detector with the SNOLAB
QETs, and compare the simulation to the data taken in the Bluefors at
SLAC. Below is a list of tasks and timeline for getting this done, and I'm
hoping you can take the lead on the G4CMP part of the simulation. We can
either try to put the G4CMP part into the SuperSim simulation Mike already
has, or have mike build the input spectrum for the G4CMP run and modify the
example geometry to run this crystal.

Once we get the list of phonon hits, we will pass off to Jon and Jorge; Jon
will run the TES simulation and Jorge will do post-processing. Xuji and I
are taking/analyzing the SLAC data. The idea is to have this done or mostly
done by the collaboration meeting as a first simulation milestone for
SNOLAB detectors and a first sanity check with detectors of the G4CMP.

This, plus the charge validation I've done at Stanford, constitutes the
first full test of G4CMP charge and phonon simulations, and will allow us to
go forward with larger detectors at voltage when we have COMSOL models and
data from test facilities (we already have a lot of HV data from UMN, just
with high noise).

Timeline for 0V Simulation

Model Backgrounds - identify sources - DONE (Mike, Noah)

SuperSim - Need to generate ~100000 detector hits given background spectrum,
hopefully done by 8/1 – Mike (should be quick)

Data - need to take pulse data to build up moderate statistics sample,
hopefully ~10,000 pulses free of background/muons data taken by 8/4 - Noah

G4CMP - need to implement G115 geometry, just needs to be a cylinder 3" in
diameter 4mm in thickness, located at top of stack - Tyler (with help from
Mike for SuperSim)

Will take care of charge and phonon absorption

Aim to be done by 8/4, run jobs over next ~3 days

TES Simulation + Postprocessing - Goal of being done by collaboration
 meeting plenary (8/13)

Modify TES simulator to read in example crystal outputs, segment into iZIP
channel layout. G115 looks like a CDMSlite detector - Jon

Do CDMSlite postprocessing on data (Xuji + Noah) and DMC (Jorge)
